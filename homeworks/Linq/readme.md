# LINQ Coding Exercise

This exercise is designed to help you practice LINQ queries in C#. Start with the [_starter_](./starter/) project, which includes both an **Exercises** and a **Tests** project. Your task is to complete the methods in the **Exercises** project and then run the tests in the **Tests** project to validate your implementation.

Each method is accompanied by detailed specifications in the C# XML documentation, along with links to the relevant LINQ method documentation that may be useful for implementation. If you're unfamiliar with any of these methods, simply click the link to review the documentation.

A [_solution_](./solution/) project is provided with sample answers. We encourage you to attempt the exercise independently before consulting the solutions. Remember, there are multiple ways to solve these problems, so don't worry if your approach differs from the sample solution. Instead, use it as an opportunity to learn and even leverage AI to deepen your understanding of the sample solutions.

**Important:** Disable all AI assistance while solving this exercise. You may face similar challenges in an exam setting without AI support. Although AI can be a helpful tool, it may occasionally provide incorrect answers. Being able to solve these problems on your own is crucial for your development as a programmer.
